// Lucide (ISC), imported per icon from a `sideEffects: false` ESM package, so
// esbuild drops the other ~6,000 exports. Nothing is inlined here and no build
// plugin is involved — the package is ordinary ESM, which is also why the test
// suites resolve it with no vitest wiring at all.
//
// One glyph per name and no dark-mode variant. Lucide is stroke-drawn, so
// there is no solid twin to swap to — and none is wanted: an outline at a
// brighter colour matches light mode's weight more closely than a filled glyph
// does, which overshoots it. Dark mode is therefore a pure colour change,
// handled entirely by `light-dark()` in styles.css, and no component needs to
// know which theme is in effect in order to draw an icon.
