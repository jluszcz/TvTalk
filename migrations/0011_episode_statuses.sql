-- What one board column intends for one episode, as opposed to what it has
-- already done. `watched` records a finished season and `posts` record having
-- been there; neither can say "Episode 8 is a recap and I am not coming."
-- Without that, silence on an episode reads as "not there yet" when it means
-- "not coming at all."
--
-- Keyed on user_id rather than an email, matching reveals, watch_sessions and
-- watch_offsets. This is the split the rest of the schema draws: authorship and
-- reactions are per individual, everything about watching is per column. A
-- couple shares a screen, so they skip the recap together.
--
-- Two enum columns rather than one. `status` has exactly one legal value today,
-- which is why this is not a reveals-style presence table: another status that
-- also takes a reason is a change to a string set in the route, with no
-- migration. One that takes no reason needs `reason` made nullable first, since
-- it is NOT NULL below — the pairing the route enforces is what lets that
-- constraint stand while only `skipping` exists. Absence of a row is the only
-- representation of "no status."
--
-- `created_at` is when the skip was first declared, and the route's upsert
-- deliberately leaves it alone when only the reason changes.
