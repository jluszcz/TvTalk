-- Optional local dev seed: sample "watched" state so the board isn't empty.
-- Apply with:
--   npx wrangler d1 execute tvtalk --local --file=seed.sql
--
-- Seasons live in migration 0002 and the roster (users + emails) lives in
-- roster.sql, so both are already present before this runs — do not duplicate
-- them here. Apply roster.sql first so these user ids exist. Do NOT run this
-- against production; it inserts fake watched rows.

-- Season 1 fully watched (grays out, sinks to the bottom); a couple of partials.
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO watched (user_id, season_id, created_at) VALUES
